This is the bubble experiment.

- Your bubble is light green
- Others bubble are light blue
- Bubbles grow over time
- When they reach a certain size, it rise and .... pop
- Then a new bubble is created

You are watching the bubble, nothing is expected of you.

You can meditate watching the bubble.

You can think of all the others that are watching their bubbles.

You are never alone on this page because you still have your bubble.

You can race other bubble if you want, just like when you were a kid.

You can think that in our world that is moving very fast, the bubble anchor you to the moment.

You can love the bubble

Your bubble is ephemeral.
